# To Do

* Add this credit somewhere:

    > All images of islands were generated with https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/mapgen4/

    > Any names were generated with: https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com
    
* Make page-by-page plan stating what content should be covered and map out general structure


* Update island picture: use a different angle on the same island for every page, have a picture at the beginning of each page.

* Maybe remove line about textbook ending with real data: link to UoB DS to show example with real dataset?

# Notes

* Leave all exercises completed for now with `# !!! replace with ...`, once all okpy tests have been tested, remove answer and comment and replace with ellipsis.

* `r_ify()` function must be run in a separate cell to `import matplotlib.pyplot`, else figsize changes may be ignored...

* add more intro to jupyter on the lists page (?)
* 
#### Run these in deepnote terminal to overwrite any changes on deepnote and replace them with repo from github

> git clean -d -f
> 
> git reset --hard
> 
> git pull
